Under the weather
Set the record straight
Walk on eggshells
Bite the bullet
Break a leg
Beat around the bush
Call it a day
Better late than never
Stick to your guns
Leave no stone unturned
Clouds on the horizon
Make a long story short
Speak of the devil
Elephant in the room
In a nutshell
Piece of cake
Get your act together
On top of the world
Time is money
Two peas in a pod
Hit the nail on the head
Hit the books
Spill the beans
Get the show on the road
The last straw
That ship has sailed
On thin ice
Give a cold shoulder
When it rains it pours
Pull someones leg
No pain no gain
See eye to eye
So far so good
When pigs fly
Curiosity killed the cat
The whole nine yards
Pain in the neck
Break the ice
Wild goose chase
Once in a blue moon
Ball is in your court
The devil is in the details
Other fish in the sea
Bounce off the walls
Bent out of shape
Throw caution to the wind
A dime a dozen
All in the same boat
Bury the hatchet
Cost an arm and a leg
Taste of your own medicine
Draw the line
The benefit of the doubt
Go the extra mile
Heat of the moment
Keep your chin up
Kill two birds with one stone
On cloud nine
Out of the blue
Over the moon
Shoot yourself in the foot
On the fence
Skeletons in the closet
Take a rain check
Through thick and thin
Throw in the towel
Turn a blind eye
Off the hook
Up in the air
Drop the ball
Go with the flow
Hang in there
In hot water
Jump on the bandwagon
Play it by ear
Keep an ear out
Save your breath
Steal the show
Jump the gun
Nip it in the bud
Get a grip
Piece of work
Seen better days
Play your cards right
Easier said than done
Ignorance is bliss
Cut to the chase
Blow off steam
Up for grabs
Back to square one
Under the wire
Right off the bat
Rock the boat
Can of worms
Over my dead body
Under the table
Under the rug
Smoke and mirrors
Easy does it
Read between the lines
